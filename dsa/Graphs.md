## Intro
#### What is a graph ?
#### Types of Graph
###### Undirected Graph
###### Directed Graphs (Digraph)
###### Weighted Graphs
###### Tree
###### Rooted Trees
####### Arborerescence (out-tree)
####### Anti - Arborerescence (in-tree)
###### Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
###### Bipartite Graph
###### Complete Graph
#### Representing Graphs (Pros and Cons)
##### Adjacency Matrix
##### Adjacency List
##### Edge List

## Problems in Graph Theory
#### Problems
##### Shortest Path Problems
BFS(Unweighted), Dijkstra's, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall, A*
##### Connectivity
Use union find data structure or search algorithm like DFS
##### Negative Cycles
Bellman Ford or Floyd Warshall
##### Strong Connected Components (Directed Graphs)
Tarjan and Kosaraju
##### Travelling Salesman Problem
Held-Karp and branch and bound
##### Bridges in Graph
##### Articulation Points
##### Minimum Spanning Trees
Krushkals, Prims and Boruvkas algorithm
##### Flow Networks
Ford Fulkerson, Edmond-Karp and Dinics
